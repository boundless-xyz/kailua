# Setup

Make sure to first install the [prerequisites](quickstart.md#prerequisites) from the quickstart
section before proceeding.

## Installation

Before you can start migrating your rollup, you'll need to build and install Kailua's binaries by calling the following
commands from the root project directory:

```admonish tip
If you have modified the FPVM binary, you will need to build/install using `-F rebuild-fpvm`.
```

```admonish info
At the cost of longer compilation time, you can embed the RISC Zero zkvm prover logic into `kailua-cli` instead of 
having it utilize your locally installed RISC Zero `r0vm` for proving.
To do this, add `-F prove` to the install command below.
```

```admonish tip
For GPU-accelerated local proving, use one of the following feature flags:
* Apple: `-F metal`
* Nvidia: `-F cuda`
```

### CLI Binary
```shell
cargo install kailua-cli --path bin/cli --locked
```

## Configuration

Once your installation is successful, you should be able to run the following command to fetch the Kailua configuration
parameters for your rollup instance:

```shell
kailua-cli config --op-node-url [YOUR_OP_NODE_URL] --op-geth-url [YOUR_OP_GETH_URL] --eth-rpc-url [YOUR_ETH_RPC_URL]
```

Running the above command against the respective Base mainnet endpoints should produce the following output:
```

```

```admonish warning
Make sure that your `FPVM_IMAGE_ID` matches the value above.
This value determines the exact program used to prove faults.
```

```admonish note
If your `RISC_ZERO_VERIFIER` value is blank, this means that your rollup might be deployed on a base layer that does
not have a deployed RISC Zero zkVM verifier contract.
This means you might have to deploy your own verifier.
Always revise the RISC Zero [documentation](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier)
to double-check verifier availability.
```

Once you have these values you'll need to save them for later use during migration.

## Telemetry

All Kailua binaries and commands support exporting telemetry data to an
[OTLP Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
The collector endpoint can be specified using the `--otlp-collector` parameter, or through specifying the
`OTLP_COLLECTOR` environment variable.
