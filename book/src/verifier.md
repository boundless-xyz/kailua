# On-chain Proof Verification

```admonish note
If you've successfully performed fast-track migration, you do not need to follow the steps on this page.
```

The cryptographic fault proofs generated by Kailua require the existence of a RISC Zero verifier contract on the parent
chain (ethereum).

```admonish tip
Use the Kailua CLI `config` command to retrieve the address of the officially deployed RISC Zero verifier for your
parent chain.
If one is available, you can use that address as your verifier and skip the steps in this section.
```

This section explains how to deploy a verifier suited to your needs, but you'll need to maintain it in case
of adopting any updates to Kailua that change the RISC Zero zkVM version used for proving.

## Verifier Contracts
This section describes the contracts that make up the on-chain proof verification pipeline.

### Verifier Router
The [RISCZeroVerifierRouter contract](https://dev.risczero.com/api/blockchain-integration/contracts/verifier#verifier-router)
routes proofs from different sources to their correct verifier.
This allows your application (and Kailua) to leverage proofs generated using different zkVM versions, or through
the [Boundless proving network](https://docs.beboundless.xyz/), while delegating the complexity of managing the
verifier version to the router contract.

Depending on your needs, you may need to deploy and manage your own verifier instead of relying on the pre-deployed
router managed by RISC Zero.

```admonish warning
The verifier deployment made by Kailua does not yet utilize the [Emergency stop](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/release-1.2/contracts/src/RiscZeroVerifierEmergencyStop.sol)
contract in the pre-deployed RISC Zero verifier, which allows anyone to permissionlessy disable a verification backend
in the router by proving a false statement.
```

### Groth16 Verifier
The [RISCZeroGroth16Verifier](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/release-1.2/contracts/src/groth16/RiscZeroGroth16Verifier.sol)
only accepts valid Groth16 proofs generated using its hardcoded RISC Zero zkVM version determined by the control root
and id constructor parameters.
This verifier is intended to be deployed and then added as a possible backend to a router instead of being used directly on its own.
However, it is possible to call and use this verifier directly if the prover and verifier versions align.

### Fake Proof Verifier (INSECURE)
This verifier accepts fake proofs generated while running the RISC Zero zkVM in "dev mode".
It is only useful for testing out the zkVM in a development environment without being delayed by proving time.
```admonish danger
Do not use the fake proof verifier anywhere near production.
```

## Deployment

This section will walk you through creating your own verifier deployment.
The commands below will be using Foundry's `forge` and `cast` utilities, which you should have installed as part of the
foundry [prerequisite](quickstart.md#prerequisites).

```admonish note
The below foundry commands expect both a parameter that determines the wallet to use and the rpc endpoint of the parent
chain.
You will have to add these two parameters manually to every command below.
For more information, refer to `forge create --help`, `cast call --help`, and `cast send --help`
```

First, change your working directory to `crates/contracts/foundry` for `forge` to work:
```shell
cd crates/contracts/foundry
```

### Router

```solidity
constructor(address admin) Ownable(admin)
```

The `RISCZeroVerifierRouter` constructor requires a single `admin` address, which is an account authorised to modify 
the router in one of two ways after it is deployed:
1. Add a new verification backend through `addVerifier`:
2. Permanently disable a verification backend through `removeVerifier`:

To deploy a new router, invoke the following command
```shell
forge create RiscZeroVerifierRouter --constructor-args [ADMIN_ADDRESS]
```

On success, you should see output similar to the following:
```
Deployer: [YOUR_DEPLOYER_WALLET_ADDRESS]
Deployed to: [YOUR_DEPLOYED_ROUTER_CONTRACT]
Transaction hash: [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_TRANSACTION_HASH]
```

```admonish success
Make sure to note down the `YOUR_DEPLOYED_ROUTER_CONTRACT` address.
We will use this in the following commands when adding proving backends.
The router cannot verify any proofs on its own.
```

### Groth16 Verifier

The Groth16 verifier validates stand-alone cryptographic proofs generated using the RISC Zero zkVM and compressed using
the RISC Zero STARK-to-SNARK wrapper.

This verifier can be deployed as follows using the control root and id from the `kailua-cli config` command output:
```shell
forge create RiscZeroGroth16Verifier --constructor-args \ 
  [YOUR_CONTROL_ROOT] \
  [YOUR_CONTROL_ID]
```
The output should again give you the relevant addresses:
```
Deployer: [YOUR_DEPLOYER_WALLET_ADDRESS]
Deployed to: [YOUR_DEPLOYED_GROTH16_VERIFIER_CONTRACT]
Transaction hash: [YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_TRANSACTION_HASH]
```

We again need to query this verifier's selector:
```shell
cast call [YOUR_DEPLOYED_GROTH16_VERIFIER_CONTRACT] \
  "SELECTOR() returns (bytes4)"
```
Yielding another 4-byte selector:
```
0xc101b42b
```

And finally we need to add this verifier to our router:
```shell
cast send \
  [YOUR_DEPLOYED_ROUTER_CONTRACT] \
  "addVerifier(bytes4 selector, address verifier)" \
  [YOUR_GROTH16_SELECTOR] \
  [YOUR_DEPLOYED_GROTH16_VERIFIER_CONTRACT]
```

```admonish success
You now have a RISC Zero verifier contract!
```
