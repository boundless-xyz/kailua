    ///   (`run_core_client`) and validates the precondition against the provided hash.
    /// - **Proof Loading (Conditional):** For zero-knowledge validations (`zkvm`), loads previously
    ///   proven FPVM journals to maintain composability and recursive proof validation.
    /// - **Execution Stitching:** Merges the precomputed execution proofs into a single verifiable
    ///   entity while associating it with a target address.
